Context API The Context API solves some of these prop drilling problems. It let you pass data to all of the components in the tree without writing them manually in each of them. Shared data can be anything: state, functions, objects, you name it, and it is accessible to all nested levels that are in the scope of the context. Redux is used mostly for application state management. To summarize it, Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree (object), which can't be changed directly. When something changes, a new object is created (using actions and reducers)
